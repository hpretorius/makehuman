The first version of MakeHuman was published in 2000, as Blender script, introducing the concept of universal mesh and prompting considerable community feedback. In 2004 MH win the Suzanne Award as better python script, and in 2005 it "move" outside Blender as standalone written in C.

Development effort is currently focused on the 1.0 Release, based on a new GUI and a 4th generation mesh. This release also incorporates considerable changes to the code base which now uses a small, efficient core application written in C, with most of the user functionality being implemented in Python. Because Python is an interpreted scripting language, this means that a wide range of scripts, plugins and utilities can be added without needing to rebuild the 
application.
