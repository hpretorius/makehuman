Abstract
--------

This module contains the Sorter class, a utility that is useful
for keeping a collection of objects sorted accoding to a custom
method. The methods that the Sorter can use to sort objects
are stored inside the Sorter, so that they can later be
accessed in convenient ways.

"""


class Sorter(object):

    The Sorter class is a utility that can be used to sort
    and generally apply ordering-based actions to lists
    of objects by using customized ordering methods.

    Ordering methods
    are functions that take an object as a parameter
    and return an orderable object that will be used as a
    sorting key.
